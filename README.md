# Development

In order to setup the development environment, you might need some system-wide dependencies such as `libjpeg-dev` and `zlib1g-dev`. Example installing it with a Debian-based distro:

```shell
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Then sync dependencies and run with **uv**:

```shell
uv sync
uv run main.py
```
# Why 'flingern'?

Flingern is a nice neighborhood in DÃ¼sseldorf where I usually take walks and have coffee.
